CIS3110 Assignment 1

Probelm Solved:
- Both processes correctly gets PID of the other process.
- A string can be sent from deepthraot to thewashingtonpost using signals.
- Incorrect signal received simulated.

Design notes / How problem was solved:
- PID of both processes was solved using "pidof" and "popen" and simply
  reading the output from the filestream into a string and converting it
  to an integer. Communication is verified also by using the PID.
- Using SIGUSR1 to represent a "1" being received and SIGUSR2 to represent
  a "0" being received, the characters of the message to be sent was
  converted to bits by division and sent via these signals. The bits were 
  then reassembled by thewashingtonpost doing the opposite process.
- Incorrect signals being received were simulated using "rand" where "0"
  represented an uninterrupted signal and the others representing flipped
  and lost signals.

Assumptions:
- It is assumed both process would quit after sending and receiving the message.
- It is assumed that deepthroat is always started before thewashingtonpost.

Limitations:
- If thewashingtonpost starts first, both processes dont fucntion properly
  as no defensive programming was implemented for this action.

Testing:
- Starting deepthroat first follwed by thewashingtonpost and sending
  "hello world" via deepthroat would result in "Message sent is: hello world"
  being output in the terminal of thewashingtonpost. Both processes then quit.
